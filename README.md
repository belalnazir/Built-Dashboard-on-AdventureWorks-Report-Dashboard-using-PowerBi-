# Power-BI-Project-Maven-Market-
This project guides through creating a Power BI report for Maven Market data. It covers data preparation, modeling, adding DAX measures, and building the report with various visualizations like matrices, KPI cards, maps, and charts to analyze Maven Market's performance and support decision-making.

Project Description:

    * Data Preparation

Step 1: I imported customer data from a CSV file, cleaned it up, and added some useful new columns.

Step 2: Next, I did the same for product data, ensuring accuracy in numbers and adding extra calculations like discount price.

Step 3: The process continued with store data, where I merged address details and extracted area codes from phone numbers.

Step 4: I repeated this for regions, making sure all regional data was correctly formatted.

Step 5: Then, I worked on the calendar data, adding various date-related columns for analysis.

Step 6: Finally, I brought in return data, ensuring its integration with other datasets.

Step 7: To complete the setup, I organized all this data into a cohesive folder structure and connected it to Power BI.

Step 8: After all this, I made sure everything was set up for easy access and navigation within Power BI.

    * Data Modeling

Here, I built the foundation of the report, organizing tables and establishing relationships between them for seamless data analysis.

    * Adding DAX Measures

This involved creating calculated columns and measures to perform advanced calculations on the data, enhancing its analytical capabilities.

    * Building the Report

I designed the visual layout of the report, including:

A main tab called "Topline Performance" with the Maven Market logo.
A Matrix visual showing key metrics like total transactions and profit by product brand, with visual enhancements like data bars and color scales.
KPI Cards displaying important metrics like total transactions, profit, and returns, with trends and targets.
Maps and Treemaps to visualize data geographically.
Column Charts to track revenue trends over time.
Gauge Charts comparing revenue against targets.
Bookmarks and notes for added insights and navigation.
This comprehensive report is now ready to provide valuable insights into Maven Market's performance and guide strategic decisions.
